# ðŸ“„ PDF Merger (Next.js App)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple PDF merging website built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). Iâ€™ve just started working on it, so things are pretty basic right now â€” but the plan is to make it much more powerful over time.

## What it does (so far)

Right now, it can:

- âœ… Merge **two** PDF files into one

Thatâ€™s it for now! But Iâ€™m working on adding more features soon â€” like merging more than two files, rearranging pages, splitting PDFs, and all the good stuff you'd expect from a proper PDF tool.

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) â€“ framework for the frontend and backend
- [React](https://reactjs.org) â€“ for the UI stuff
- [PDF-Merger-JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdf-merger-js) â€“ to handle the actual PDF merging

## In Progress / Coming Soon

- [ ] Upload more than two files
- [ ] Drag & drop interface
- [ ] Rearrange PDF pages
- [ ] Split PDF files
- [ ] Compress PDFs
- [ ] Convert between PDF & other formats (Word, Excel, etc.)

## ðŸ”§ How to run it locally

If you want to check it out or test it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-merger-app.git
cd pdf-merger-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Plans

This project is still in its early stages. The idea is to build something that works well, looks clean, and runs fast â€” kind of like a free alternative to the big PDF tools out there.
